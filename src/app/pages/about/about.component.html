            <h5 class="text-white">THE EARLY YEARS</h5>
            <p class="text-white sub">When the first Royal Enfield motorcycle rolled out in 1901, it was the beginning of an endearing story that would turn into a legend by the turn of the century. Aptly christened - Made Like a Gun - the phrase epitomize the simple, resilient and dependable machines that have stood the test of time and terrain. It continues to be one of the key inspirations for everything that Royal Enfield builds. </p>

            <h5 class="text-white"> THE INDIAN CONNECTION</h5>
            <p class="text-white sub">The British roots of Royal Enfield got an Indian soul in 1955, when Madras Motors started manufacturing the motorcycles in Chennai. Six decades later, it has led the leisure motorcycling culture in India from the front. The iconic motorcycles have been accomplices to a thousand adventures and the dependable steed of the men in uniform. The upbeat response to the latest models is testimony to the fact that motorcycles are still trusted, loved and rode upon.</p>
